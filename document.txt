1. Requirement Gathering
========================
1.1 Objective :- 
  a. Lightweight software: A good goal, especially if performance and speed are critical for users who frequently interact with databases.
  b. Simple UI: Simplicity is crucial for usability, especially for non-technical users or those who aren't database experts.
  c. Customization: Providing features not available in other software can differentiate your product, making it valuable to users with specific needs.
  d. Foreign keys and constraint notifications: A great feature to help users understand database relationships and avoid constraint violations.
  e. SQL Query Box: Advanced users appreciate direct SQL query execution for greater control.
  f. Pagination and Lazy Loading: This ensures efficient data handling, especially for large datasets, improving performance and user experience.
  g. Column Search: A very useful feature, especially for tables with many columns.
  h. Bulk Row Deletion with Alert: Important for data management, especially in scenarios where users might want to clean or update their tables.
  i. Rollback Option: A must-have feature to ensure that accidental changes can be reverted, offering a layer of security.
  j. Allow users to export table data in formats like CSV, Excel, or JSON.
  k. Keep a log of all changes made (queries executed, tables modified, etc.) for auditing purposes.

1.2 Problems to solve :-
  a. complex query operations
  b. handling large datasets
  c. pLack of Insight into Database Constraints
  d. Lack of Error Prevention and Rollbacks
  e. Poor UI for Query Execution
  f. No Easy Way to Delete Multiple Rows with Confidence
  g. Lack of Customization
  h. Inconsistent Data Entry
  i. Difficulties in Managing Relationships Between Tables
  j. Difficulty in Auditing Changes
  k. Data Import/Export

1.3 Specific Goals :-
  c. Ensure at least 95% of users can perform basic CRUD operations without external help
  b. Reduce the average time to perform database operations by 50%.
  b. Achieve a reduction in the time required to perform common database tasks by 40%.
  c. Complete the software development within the 5-day time constraint.

1.4 Target Audience :-
  a. Database administrators.
  b. Data analysts.
  c. Software developers.
  d. Non-technical users who need to access and manipulate data.

1.5 Inclusions :-
  a. User-friendly GUI for database operations.
  b  Support for basic SQL operations (select, insert, update, delete).
  c. Features for managing and visualizing foreign key relationships.
  d. Pagination and search functionality for efficient data handling.

1.6 Exclusions (beyond the initial scope) :-
  a. Advanced SQL features
  b. multi-database support
  c. extensive customization.
   
Constraints
  a. Time Constraint: Development must be completed within 5 days.
  b. Resource Constraint: All necessary hardware and software setups will be provided.

Assumptions
  a. Users have basic computer skills and familiarity with database concepts, but may not be SQL experts.
  b. Internal team members will provide feedback during the development process to ensure the software meets their needs.
